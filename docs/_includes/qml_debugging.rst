Debugging module
================

This code implements a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for a binary classification task. The model processes input data from pressure sensors, likely for some sort of physical system. The quantum part of the model is a quantum neural network (QNN) that processes the input data using a quantum circuit. The classical part of the model is a feedforward neural network (FNN) with two hidden layers.

Here's a brief explanation of the code structure:

1. Import necessary libraries and tools such as JAX, Haiku, Optax, PennyLane, etc.
2. Load the training and testing data (commented out in the provided code).
3. Define the quantum layer and the entire quantum circuit for the QNN model.
4. Define the forward pass for the quantum model (`qforward`) and the classical model (`cforward`).
5. Initialize the parameters and the optimizer.
6. Define the `loss_fn` function to calculate the loss value between the predicted output and the ground truth.
7. Define the `update` function to update the model parameters based on the gradients calculated.
8. Implement the training loop that iterates through epochs, shuffles the training data, trains the model, and calculates the test accuracy (commented out in the provided code).
9. Test the model and print the test accuracy (commented out in the provided code).

This hybrid quantum-classical model has the potential to leverage the advantages of quantum computing for certain problems while still utilizing classical computing resources for other parts of the model. The training loop, optimizer, and loss function are all handled by the JAX library, which simplifies gradient calculations and model updates. PennyLane is used to create the quantum circuit and integrate it with JAX.
